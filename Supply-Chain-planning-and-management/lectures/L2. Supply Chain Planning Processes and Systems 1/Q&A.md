## **1. What should an effective Supply Chain Planning and Control System seek to achieve?**

An effective supply chain planning and control system should seek to balance supply with demand in a way that satisfies customers while using resources efficiently. It should ensure that customer demand is met through competitive lead times, reliable delivery, accuracy, and flexibility, thereby generating repeat orders and long-term customer satisfaction.

In addition, such a system should enable the organisation to respond to changes in the external environment, such as fluctuations in demand or supply disruptions. It should also prepare the organisation to meet future demand by planning capacity, inventory, and resources in appropriate detail. An effective planning and control system should maintain stability in operations, provide information for production and supplier planning, support performance monitoring, and highlight potential future problems related to capacity, inventory, or resources so that corrective action can be taken in advance.

## **2. Why do we need to forecast for supply chain and operations planning?**

Forecasting is required because future demand is uncertain, while supply and capacity are often difficult or costly to change in the short term. Organisations need forecasts to support long-term strategic decisions, such as whether demand is sufficient to justify entering or remaining in a market and whether to invest in facilities, infrastructure, or supply capacity.

Forecasts are also needed in the medium term to plan and adjust resources, such as recruiting or shedding labour and balancing production across multiple sites. In the short term, forecasting enables efficient and responsive operations by supporting decisions related to production scheduling, inventory replenishment, maintenance planning, and distribution. Without forecasting, organisations would be forced to react to demand changes rather than plan proactively, leading to inefficiencies, higher costs, and poorer customer service.

## **3. Explain the difference between qualitative (subjective) forecasting methods and quantitative (objective) forecasting methods and outline two qualitative forecasting approaches.**

Qualitative forecasting methods are based on human judgement, experience, and expertise rather than mathematical analysis of historical data. They are particularly useful when little or no historical data exists, such as for new products, new markets, or long-term strategic forecasting. These methods are often applied at higher levels of planning and over longer time horizons.

Quantitative forecasting methods, in contrast, rely on mathematical models that analyse historical data to identify patterns such as trends, seasonality, or cycles. These methods are most effective when reliable historical data is available and demand patterns are relatively stable. Quantitative methods are commonly used for short-term and operational planning.

One qualitative forecasting approach is **market research**, which involves collecting data from customers or potential customers to assess preferences and likely purchasing behaviour. Another qualitative approach is the **Delphi method**, which uses a panel of experts who provide forecasts anonymously over several rounds, with feedback provided between rounds to reach a more informed consensus.

## **4. Inventory may be held for economic reasons and/or as a buffer against uncertainty in supply or demand. Explain why and give examples of each case.**

### Economies of Scale

Inventory may be held in a supply chain to exploit **economies of scale**, which occur in several ways:

- **Purchasing economies of scale**  
  Economies of scale may occur in purchasing where an organisation purchases large volumes of a commodity product that it needs in its pipeline (e.g. standard screws used in the assembly of products) to benefit from a low unit price. Although beneficial economically, this results in stock levels being higher than immediately needed.

- **Production economies of scale**  
  Production systems also benefit from economies of scale. Large production batches reduce the unit production cost of each item because production facilities can run more smoothly with fewer stoppages and changeovers (e.g. furniture products). This may result in a build-up of more stock than immediately needed to satisfy demand.

- **Transportation economies of scale**  
  Similarly, inventory levels may rise because of economies of scale from transporting large volumes of products (e.g. it may be cheaper for a clothing retailer to transport a large batch by ship from Bangladesh to the UK than many smaller batches by air).

### Buffer Against Uncertainty in Supply

Inventory may be held to provide a buffer against uncertainty in supply. For example, a medical equipment company may stockpile titanium because it believes there may be future problems in sourcing this material. Inventories may also be held to buffer against the variable time required to transport inventory from the source to the point of use or sale. For instance, imported steel products may take a long and variable time to be transported from one country to another.

### Buffer Against Uncertainty in Demand

Inventory may be held to provide a buffer against uncertainty in demand. For example, cold weather products such as de-icers and snow shovels may be held in storage to meet demand when cold weather events occur. Finished products may also be produced and stored over a long period to meet predicted demand in a future period; for example, children’s toys are produced and held in inventory in anticipation of demand during the Christmas period.

## **5. What do we mean by ABC classification of inventory items and why is it important?**

ABC classification is a method of categorising inventory items based on their relative importance, typically measured by value or contribution to revenue. It is based on the Pareto principle, which suggests that a small proportion of items usually accounts for a large proportion of the total inventory value.

Under ABC classification, **A items** represent a small number of items with very high value, **B items** represent items of moderate value, and **C items** represent a large number of items with low value. ABC classification is important because it allows organisations to focus their management attention and control effort on the most critical items. By applying tight control to A items and simpler control methods to B and C items, firms can manage large-scale inventory more efficiently and reduce overall inventory costs without compromising service levels.

## **6. Define what is meant by the capacity of an operational system.**

The capacity of an operational system refers to the maximum level of output or throughput that the system can achieve over a given period of time. It represents the upper limit on the rate at which inputs can be transformed into outputs under specified operating conditions.

Capacity is a critical concept in operations and supply chain planning because it places a constraint on how much demand can be met. Inadequate capacity can lead to congestion, delays, and lost sales, while excess capacity can result in high costs and underutilised resources.

---

## **7. What is the difference between design capacity and effective capacity?**

Design capacity is the maximum output that an operational system is capable of achieving under ideal conditions. It assumes that equipment, workforce, facilities, and processes operate exactly as intended, without disruptions or inefficiencies.

Effective capacity, in contrast, represents the realistic output that can be achieved under normal operating conditions. It takes into account factors such as maintenance requirements, workforce availability, product mix, and operational constraints. As a result, effective capacity is typically lower than design capacity and provides a more realistic basis for planning and control decisions.

---

## **8. What is meant by utilisation of capacity and why is it important?**

Capacity utilisation refers to the proportion of effective capacity that is actually used over a given period of time. It is usually expressed as a percentage and indicates how intensively an organisation is using its available resources.

Utilisation is important because low utilisation may indicate inefficiency and wasted resources, while very high utilisation can lead to congestion, longer lead times, quality problems, and reduced flexibility. Monitoring utilisation helps managers identify capacity losses, balance efficiency with responsiveness, and make informed decisions about capacity expansion, reduction, or improvement.
