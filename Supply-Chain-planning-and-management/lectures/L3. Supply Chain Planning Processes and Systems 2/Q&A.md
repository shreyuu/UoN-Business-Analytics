## **1. Explain the Hierarchical Production Planning (HPP) process.**

The Hierarchical Production Planning (HPP) process is a structured approach to planning and controlling operations at different levels of detail and over different time horizons. It recognises that not all planning decisions can or should be made at the same level of detail.

At the top of the hierarchy, long-term business and strategic plans are developed, setting overall objectives and constraints for the organisation. These plans are then translated into medium-term aggregate plans, which balance forecast demand with capacity and resources. At lower levels, the plans become increasingly detailed, including master production scheduling, materials and resource coordination, and finally order scheduling and shop-floor control. Each level operates within the constraints set by the level above, helping to ensure feasibility, stability, and consistency across the planning system.

## **2. What does Aggregate Planning seek to achieve? What decisions are typically made in aggregate planning?**

Aggregate planning seeks to balance forecast demand with available capacity and resources over a medium-term planning horizon, typically between 6 and 18 months. The objective is to ensure that the organisation can meet expected demand in a feasible and cost-effective way while maintaining stability in operations.

Decisions made in aggregate planning are taken at an aggregated level, such as product families or groups rather than individual items. Typical decisions include setting overall production rates, workforce levels, overtime and subcontracting policies, and inventory levels. Aggregate planning also considers known constraints on major facilities and resources and aligns operational plans with strategic objectives. The resulting aggregate plan provides a framework for more detailed planning at lower levels.

## **3. What is Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP) and how does it differ from Aggregate Planning?**

Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP) is a cross-functional planning process that aligns demand plans developed by sales and marketing with supply plans developed by operations and the supply chain. Its primary purpose is to ensure that different functional areas agree on a single, realistic, and workable plan.

While aggregate planning focuses mainly on balancing demand and capacity from an operations perspective, S&OP emphasises communication, coordination, and agreement across functions. S&OP is typically conducted more frequently than aggregate planning and is more dynamic and responsive to changes in market conditions. It ensures that business strategy is translated into realistic operational plans that are supported and accepted across the organisation.

## Q4. Describe briefly the main inputs to an MRP system and the main outputs that are generated by a basic MRP system.

### Main Inputs to a Basic MRP System

Basic MRP systems require **three main inputs**:

1. **Master Production Schedule (MPS)**  
   The MPS is a primary input to an MRP system. It is a statement of what the organisation intends to produce at the _independent demand_ level over future time periods.  
   For example, it specifies how many final products of each type need to be ready each week over a six-month period.  
   The MRP system uses this information to begin its calculations.

2. **Bills of Materials (BOMs)**  
   BOMs contain all the information on how each product is made.  
   The MRP system needs this information to perform its calculations.  
   BOMs require an extensive database, typically called a _parts master file_ in traditional MRP systems.

3. **Inventory Information**  
   This includes:
   - Inventory currently in stock (on-hand inventory)
   - Inventory already on order from suppliers and its expected arrival dates

   The MRP system requires this information to perform its calculations.  
   As with BOMs, inventory information requires an extensive database.

### Main Outputs of a Basic MRP System

Basic MRP systems generate **two main outputs**:

1. **Purchasing Plan**  
   Shows which items need to be purchased from suppliers, in what quantities, and when the purchase orders should be released.

2. **Production Plan**  
   Consists of work orders that specify the parts, components, and sub-assemblies that must be produced by the firm within specific time periods.

### Additional Output

- Basic MRP systems may also generate a **materials coordination plan** to ensure that purchased materials and in-house production activities are properly coordinated.

## **5. Explain generally how an MRP system does its calculations.**

An MRP system performs its calculations by translating requirements for finished products into time-phased requirements for components and materials. Starting from the Master Production Schedule, the system uses the Bill of Materials to explode demand down through the product structure, determining the gross requirements for each component.

The MRP system then uses inventory records to subtract on-hand inventory and scheduled receipts, resulting in net requirements. These net requirements are time-phased using lead times through a process known as backward scheduling, which determines when orders must be released to ensure components are available when needed. The outcome of these calculations is a set of planned production orders and purchase orders for materials and components.

---

## **6. What is the Master Production Schedule (MPS) in an MRP system?**

The Master Production Schedule (MPS) is a key input to the MRP system and represents a statement of what the organisation intends to produce at the independent demand level over future time periods. It specifies the quantities of finished products that must be completed in each period, such as weekly or monthly buckets, over a defined planning horizon.

The MPS is derived from aggregate plans, customer orders, and demand forecasts, and it drives all subsequent MRP calculations. Once the MPS is fixed, the MRP system uses it to determine detailed material and component requirements.

## **7. MRPII requires capacity checking – why is this necessary and at what levels are capacities checked?**

Capacity checking is necessary in MRPII because basic MRP systems assume that sufficient capacity exists to execute the material plan. In reality, material feasibility does not guarantee capacity feasibility, and an MRP plan may not be achievable with available resources.

MRPII introduces capacity checks at multiple levels. At a high level, rough-cut capacity planning is used to test the feasibility of the Master Production Schedule by estimating workload on key resources. At a more detailed level, capacity requirements planning checks whether sufficient capacity exists at specific work centres to execute the detailed MRP plan. These checks help ensure that both material and capacity constraints are considered.

---

## **8. What is a capacity requirements plan (CRP) and when is it generated?**

A capacity requirements plan (CRP) is an output of an MRPII system that shows the workload imposed on production resources over time as a result of the MRP plan. It provides detailed information on capacity requirements at specific work centres and time periods.

The CRP is generated after the MRP calculations have been completed and material plans are available. It allows planners to identify capacity overloads or underutilisation and to take corrective actions such as adjusting overtime, reallocating labour, changing routings, or subcontracting work. The CRP therefore plays a critical role in ensuring that production plans are feasible.

## **9. Why are accurate data and appropriate parameter settings necessary for effective MRP/MRPII systems?**

Accurate data and appropriate parameter settings are essential because MRP and MRPII systems are highly sensitive to input quality. Errors in the Master Production Schedule, Bills of Materials, or inventory records can lead to incorrect calculations, resulting in material shortages, excess inventory, or infeasible schedules.

In addition, incorrect parameter settings such as lead times, lot sizes, or safety stock levels can distort planning outputs even when the underlying data is accurate. Because MRP systems rely heavily on automated calculations, small errors can propagate throughout the system. Therefore, maintaining accurate data and well-calibrated parameters is critical for effective planning and control.

## **10. What is an ERP system and what parts of the planning hierarchy does ERP support?**

An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is an integrated information system that supports and links all major business processes within an organisation using a common database. ERP systems cover operational and transactional aspects of the business, including production, supply chain, finance, human resources, and sales.

ERP systems support multiple levels of the planning hierarchy, from business and aggregate planning through to master planning, materials and capacity planning, and operational control. Many ERP systems incorporate MRPII-type planning modules and provide real-time data and reporting across functions, helping to improve coordination and decision-making throughout the organisation.

## **11. Why have cloud-based ERP systems become important in supply chain and operations planning and management?**

Cloud-based ERP systems have become important because they offer greater flexibility, scalability, and accessibility compared to traditional on-premise systems. Cloud solutions allow organisations to scale their operations quickly without large upfront investment in IT infrastructure.

In addition, cloud-based ERP systems support real-time data sharing, collaboration across geographically dispersed supply chain partners, and faster system updates. These features are particularly valuable in modern supply chains, which are global, dynamic, and subject to frequent change. As a result, cloud-based ERP systems enable more responsive and cost-effective supply chain and operations planning.
