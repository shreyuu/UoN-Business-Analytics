        "# FBA Computing Session Week 1: Intro\n",
        "\n",
        "In this session we will aim to get comfortable with Google Colaboratory,\n",
        "introducing Jupyter notebooks and show how it is used for Python programming. We won’t be using any program files in this tutorial, but just testing out/getting a feel for Python commands in its “interactive mode”.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is Programming:\n",
        "\n",
        "Television shows and films often show programmers furiously typing cryptic streams of 1s and 0s on glowing screens, but modern programming isn’t that mysterious. Programming is simply the act of entering instructions for the computer to perform. These instructions might crunch some numbers, modify text, look up information in files, or communicate with other computers over the Internet.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What do we need for it:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A language that defines a set of words and rules that we are going to learn this semester to send instructions to the computer [**Python**]\n",
        "\n",
        "2. A development environment, to type in our language instructions, execute them and look at the results [**Jupyter Notebooks**]\n",
        "\n",
        "3. A language interpreter, that converts our written Python code into ‘machine code’ and vice versa.  [**Python Interpreter**]\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Jupyter Notebooks are simply a convenient graphical interface to write and execute Python code. However, there are a lot of other development environments such as  IDLE - “the Python Integrated Development Environment”, ECLIPSE, VIM, emacs... and even online versions such as the one at repl.it (please feel free to try any of these - have a look at https://repl.it for example).\n",
        "\n",
        "This year for Foundational Business Analytics we will be using Google Colaboratory. Colaboratory is based on Jupyter open source project. Colaboratory allows you to use and share Jupyter notebooks with others without having to download, install, or run anything on your own computer (or tablet) other than a browser.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Python interactive mode\n",
        "\n",
        "Python has two basic modes: script and interactive.\n",
        "1. The script mode is the mode where a script (i.e. a succession of commands) is run in the Python interpreter until it finishes and outputs results (on the screen, in a file, on a plot, ...).\n",
        "2. The interactive mode gives immediate feedback for each statement which is a good way to play around and try variations on syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Like a calculator\n",
        "\n",
        "Typing mathematical operations in the Python interactive mode is very much like using a calculator so let's experiment with that.\n",
        "\n",
        "Type a mathematical operation of your choice in the box below and execute it by pressing  or the 'Run' button at the top of the screen or using the 'Shift' + 'Enter' keyboard shortcut.\n",
        "\n",
        "You should see the result of your operation on the next line (or 'Out [..]' line in Jupyter).\n",
