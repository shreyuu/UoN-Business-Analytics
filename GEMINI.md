# Gemini Workspace Overview

This directory contains course materials for a Business Analytics program, likely from the University of Nottingham. The materials are organized into three main modules: Data and Society (D@S), Foundational Business Analytics (FBA), and Supply-Chain planning and management.

## Directory Overview

- **`D@S/`**: This directory appears to hold materials for a "Data at Scale" course. It includes Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), data files, and lecture slides (`.pdf`). The content seems to focus on data cleaning, working with web APIs, and SQL.

- **`FBA/`**: This directory contains materials for a "Foundational Business Analytics" course. It is rich with Jupyter notebooks for weekly practice sessions, various datasets in `.csv` format, and a dedicated `coursework` sub-directory. The focus here is on hands-on data analysis using Python.

- **`Supply-Chain-planning-and-management/`**: This directory contains materials related to business process modeling, specifically focusing on supply chain management. It includes several flowchart diagrams and related markdown files.

## Key Files

- **`FBA/FBA_Week_01_Intro_&_Python_Practice.ipynb`**: An introductory Jupyter notebook for the FBA course. It covers Python basics, including mathematical operations, strings, variables, data types, and conditional statements, all within the context of a business case study.

- **`FBA/coursework/main.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook for the FBA coursework. This is likely where the main analysis for the course is performed.

- **`D@S/shopping_data_small/main.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook in the D@S module that likely deals with analyzing the provided "shopping_data_small" dataset.

- **`Supply-Chain-planning-and-management/flowchart-1.md`**: A markdown file containing a flowchart, likely related to supply chain planning.

## Usage

This directory is a collection of educational materials. The primary way to interact with the content is by:

- **Running the Jupyter notebooks**: The `.ipynb` files can be opened and run using a Jupyter environment (like Jupyter Lab or Google Colab) to follow the course exercises and analyses.
- **Reviewing the lecture slides**: The `.pdf` files in the `D@S` directory are likely lecture slides that provide theoretical context for the practical exercises.
- **Examining the data**: The `.csv` files can be explored to understand the datasets used in the courses.
