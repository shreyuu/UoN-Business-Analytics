        "# Implementing Orange Dataflows in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember libraries just provide custom functions and custom data objects. Combining them in a workflow is the same as connecting the custom data processing functions widgets provide in Orange.\n",
        "\n",
        "An important difference between Orange and Python is that while Orange passes data along links in the background to *Widgets* in Python we explicitly pass the data (as a custom data object) between *functions*.\n",
        "\n",
        "This has positives and negatives:\n",
        "1. We have to know about the data format (-ve)\n",
        "2. We can at any time get statistics / ask questions about our data (+ve)\n",
        "\n",
        "In standard machine learning tasks (i.e. those covered by Orange) all data exists in a table (two-dimensional array) like format with rows representing data points and columns representing features. In a supervised setting where we have labels one of these columns will be output feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a number of choices for the custom data object, two common ones:\n",
        "1. **A two-dimensional (numpy) array**: The simplest implementation you can have, also the fastest\n",
        "2. **A pandas Dataframe**: Aa custom object that encapsulates a two-dimensional array but also includes meta-data and methods to easily summarize and manipulate data for use within a standard machine learning task).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Throughout this module we'll be using pandas Dataframes**. However, if you are interested in learning more about using numpy arrays please ask!\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important difference is that, unlike Orange, we do not select widgets (and access help regarding widgets) from a graphical interface. Rather, we must know (google) their existence and read their documentation online.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Having trouble?\n",
        "1. In class? Ask us!\n",
        "2. If it's basic Python it might be worth [brushing up on your understanding of that first.](https://snakify.org)\n",
        "3. If it's with concepts surrounding numpy, sklearn or pandas take a look at the material from FBA which covered 99% all concepts in here - this is primarily a refresh in a slightly different context.\n",
        "\n",
